# K-Means Clustering on Cars Dataset

## Overview

This project demonstrates the application of K-Means clustering using scikit-learn on a cars dataset. K-Means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning technique used for grouping similar data points into clusters based on their features. In this project, we use the scikit-learn library to perform K-Means clustering on a dataset containing information about cars.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the 'mtcars' dataset, which is included in the R programming language by default. The dataset contains information about various car models, including features such as miles per gallon (mpg), displacement (disp), and horsepower (hp). The goal is to cluster these cars into groups based on these features.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the provided code)

You can install scikit-learn using pip:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cars-kmeans.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd cars-kmeans
   ```

3. Run the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script to perform K-Means clustering on the 'mtcars' dataset.

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook cars_kmeans.ipynb
   ```

   - The notebook contains step-by-step instructions and code for loading the dataset, preprocessing the data, running K-Means clustering, and visualizing the results.
   - Alternatively, you can run the Python script directly:

     ```bash
     python cars_kmeans.py
     ```

4. Examine the clustering results and explore how cars are grouped based on their features.

## Results

The project results in the following:

- Clustering of cars into groups based on similarities in their 'mpg', 'disp', and 'hp' features.
- Visualization of the clusters to understand the relationships between car models.

## Acknowledgments

- The 'mtcars' dataset used in this project is available in the R programming language and was originally created by General Motors.
